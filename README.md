# Fitness-Tracker
A program detailing my own workouts, ranging from cardio, weights, and boxing. 

# About Me 
As a current IT student and competitive amateur boxer, I believe it's imperative to track my training progress to see the trends in my routine. This is a personal project to further develop my Python skills, a skill I developed in my Object-Oriented Programming class and will continue to use in my Scripting class in the Winter 2026 semester.
